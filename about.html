        <h1>Website Development Assignment 1a</h1>
        <p>On this page I will talk more about myself including my hobbies and other things</p>
        <p>I am from Poland but for most of my life I stayed here in Ireland, I went to Primary School here and this year just finished Secondary School,
        I did not have a chance to do the leaving cert due to covid-19 being a huge issue around the world this year, instead we got preditcated grades
        which I was worried about ever since they officially cancelled the Leaving Cert back in April 2020. Luckily the worry was for nothing as I got into
        my first choice course of Software Systems Development and I am so far enjoying it. During my spare time I like to play video games alone or with a 
        group of friends depending on the game and if they able to play. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061377093/">my steam page</a> On this page I will include a list of my favourite things. My favourite quote is 
        <blockquote>"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."</blockquote>
